# University
For posterity; some assignments from my university days. Created between 
2000-2003.

All sources are C++ and most rely on the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (glut32.dll), a 
window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs. Originally, the
programs were created with Visual Studio 6.0.

In order to compile and run on a more modern stack, the programs are updated to 
use FreeGLUT (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) and Visual Studio Community 2017.
